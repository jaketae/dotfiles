# Dotfiles

This repository contains a growing collection of dotfiles that I use to configure various parts of my workflow. 

## Purpose

Saving dofiles on GitHub serves several purposes:

* Motivate myself to continuously improve my workflow configuration
* Prepare for the worst case scenario in which my workstation fails
* Provide a novice-friendly dotfile setup

## Philosophy

This is a highly minimalist setting that contains just the bare bones necessary to get things started. While I try to strike the right balance between the absolute default and extensive customization, I'm primarily guided by the minimalist principle that things are better left untouched than modified.

With that said, I definitely plan on updating the dotfiles to apply tweaks that tailor to my personal preferences, especially Vim.

## Files

Currently, the following list of settings are available:

* vimrc
* sublime
* bash_profile
* gittemplate

## Installation

To apply these settings to your workstation, simply copy and paste the lines of code to your corresponding files. I plan on writing a simple bash script to achieve this in the near future.
