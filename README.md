# Dotfiles

This repository contains a growing collection of dotfiles that I use to configure various parts of my workflow. 

## Purpose

Saving dofiles on GitHub serves several purposes:

* Share my preference files with the community
* Motivate myself to continuously improve my workflow configuration
* Prepare for the worst case scenario in which my workstation fails

## Philosophy

This is a highly minimalist setting that contains just the bare bones necessary to get things started. While I try to strike the right balance between the absolute default and extensive customization, I'm primarily guided by the minimalist principle that things are better left untouched than heaviy modified.
